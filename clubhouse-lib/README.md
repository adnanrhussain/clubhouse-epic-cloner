## Getting Started

### Installation

You can install clubhouse-lib with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).

```shell
npm install --save clubhouse-lib
```

or

```shell
yarn add clubhouse-lib
```

### How to Get an API Token

The Clubhouse API uses token-based authentication, you will need one to use this library.

To generate an API token, go to https://app.clubhouse.io/settings/account/api-tokens. To make it easier to explore our API, we recommend saving this token as an environment variable in your local dev environment:

```bash
export CLUBHOUSE_API_TOKEN="YOUR API TOKEN HERE"
```

This will allow you to copy and paste many examples in the documentation to try them out.

Requests made with a missing or invalid token will get a `401 Unauthorized` response. All requests must be made over HTTPS. Tokens provide complete access to your Clubhouse account, **so keep them secure**. Donâ€™t paste them into your source code, use an environment variable instead. For security reasons, we will immediately invalidate any tokens we find have been made public.

## Usage

```javascript
import Clubhouse from 'clubhouse-lib';

const client = Clubhouse.create('your token value'); // See https://github.com/clubhouse/clubhouse-lib#how-to-get-an-api-token

client.listMembers().then(console.log);

client.getMember('')
  .catch(x => console.error(x.body))
  .then(console.log);

client.listProjects().then(console.log);
```
